ClassicGauges 

A simple Qt Safe Renderer & dynamic telltales demo application.

The main branch of this will not work without the Qt Safe Renderer.
Furthermore, the Qt Safe Renderer used in this demo is patched to allow it to 
be embedded as a QtWidget.

Additionally, the "safe code" here is written with a dependency on main-line
Qt itself. Main line Qt is "Software of Unknown Provenance", i.e. too big and 
changes too fast to be certified in any meaningful way. The code is provided to
highlight the QSR API, and should not be used as a guide to writing MISRA 
compliant, certifiable C++ code.
